Utility to generate campaign finance filings for candidates/office-holders and specific
purpose committees.

This project is in development.

For design information, please see the wiki: https://github.com/chip-rosenthal/tecfiler/wiki

Background
----------

The requirements for candidate and lobbyist disclosures are set by the Texas
Ethics Commission (TEC): http://www.ethics.state.tx.us/main/local.html

Local candidate and lobbyist disclosures are filed not with the State, but with
the Austin City Clerk.

Clerk takes filings on paper (or PDF versions of the forms).

The filings are posted online but are not easily searchable:
http://www.austintexas.gov/department/campaign-finance-reports

In April, the City Council passed an ordinance to create an online, searchable
database of campaign and lobbyist filings:
http://www.austintexas.gov/edims/document.cfm?id=169484

Initial staff estimates to implement have come back with: about 800K cost,
about a year development, solution based on proprietary technology

In a meeting organized by Councilmember Morrison, city staff was open to the
idea of a "civic sourced" effort to help reduce costs and time.

Some complexities not addressed:

* There are additional forms, such as the treasurer filing and correction
  filings, that are not scoped at this time.

* There are additional schedules that the City of Austin uses, that are not
  scoped in this discussion.

* Local government can require electronic filings, but the process is going to
  need TEC approval.

**TEC Automation and Import Format**

The state provides free software for electronic filing with the state. The software can
be used to generate reports for local filing, but does not support electronic filing locally.

The state software allows import of contributions and expenditures. Our tool will be
modeled around this import format. It is documented in the TX-CFA Import Guide:

http://www.ethics.state.tx.us/whatsnew/ImportGuide.pdf


Development Status
------------------

There is currently a prototype "import engine" that would load CSV files in a standard form 
defined by the TEC, save them in a database, and (if desired) produce the standard TEC forms as PDFs.

Now that we've got a workable data model and PDF rendering tool, we'd like to build a web-based app. 
When complete, this will provide a complete solution for campaigns to file their financial reports, 
and provide public transparency to funds in the political system.

The import engine is written in ruby, and the web framework has been created in rails. 
They need to be merged. 


Installation Notes
------------------

These instructions will help get the rails web framework installed. The import engine 
currently lives in the dm-import-engine branch.

    git clone https://github.com/chip-rosenthal/tecfiler.git
    cd tecfiler
    bundle install

- Copy config/database_example.yml to database.yml and edit it for your preferred db.

- Copy config/email_example.yml to email.yml and edit it for your email server settings. Devise is configured to require account confirmation via email.

- Migrate the database:
     
     bundle exec rake db:migrate

- Start the web server:
     
     rails server 

- Go to http://localhost:3000/

- Admin interface is at http://localhost:3000/admin (demo account login is "admin@example.com" and password is "password")


Production Notes
----------------

Before running in a production environment, be sure to update the secret token to a unique value:

    rake secret

Edit your config/initializers/secret_token.rb file to add the secret token:

    TecfilerAr::Application.config.secret_token = '...some really long, random string...'
